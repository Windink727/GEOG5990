- Project Background:

Public safety has always been a topic of concern for people. data.police.uk has been collecting and processing relevant data and generating open data for everyone to read and analyse. 

Python, as the main tool for data analysis, makes it easier and faster to work with this data and to target useful data through visualizations that can be presented and illustrated to a specific target audience.

- Purpose, methods and data

This study generates a non-spatial visualization of house prices and burglary as a Crime type in Leeds by applying the West Yorkshire Crime Records data downloaded from data.police.uk from October to December 2021 and the 2021 median house price summary data downloaded from cdrc.ac.uk, and determines whether the two are positively correlated by applying the pre-processing steps of querying and deleting to determine whether the two are positively correlated or not. To urge residents living in the relevant house prices to increase their self-awareness.

In addition, multiple clusters of Leeds crime records were obtained using k-means clustering and spatial visualisations were generated. The coordinate points at the centre of the clusters were acquired. It is recommended that a new police station be built in the centre of the clusters, which will better prevent crime, protect the neighbourhood, provide rapid police response, rationally allocate police resources and better protect the public interest.
